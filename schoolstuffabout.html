    <h3>My goal with this site is to make sure everybody has fun when doing your "school stuff". So make sure to play this site all the time. By the way unlike clegga clicker this site is not AI slop and I am using my limited html/css experience to code it. Also shoutout to my 8th grade coding teacher for teaching me this stuff because I wouldn't be here without you lol. Finally, to conclude this paragraph I would like to shout out keegz because he is a huge W!</h3>

<h3>Make sure to try out clegga clicker/tetris at the top or try out my friends games: </h3>
